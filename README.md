Hey there, I'm Moncy!

Welcome to my GitHub! Over the past 5 years, I've been neck-deep in full-stack web development, getting my hands dirty with everything from JavaScript to Node.js, React, and Python. I love the process of transforming a cool idea into lines of code that eventually come to life as fully functional web apps.

Being a part of the open-source community has been a fantastic ride for me. I enjoy the collaboration, the sharing of ideas, and the thrill of seeing my contributions make a difference. And when I'm not typing away on my keyboard, I'm either diving into the latest trends in the tech world or sharing my experiences with others who are new to the coding scene.

I'm a firm believer in never stopping learning - it's a wild ride, but the tech world doesn't stand still, and neither do I. Have a look around my repos to get a feel for what I've been up to. And hey, if you're up for a chat or a collab, just drop me a line. Let's code!
