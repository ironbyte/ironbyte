Hey there, I'm Moncy! ðŸ˜…

Welcome to my GitHub! Over the past 5 years, I've been neck-deep in full-stack web development, getting my hands dirty with everything from JavaScript to Node.js, React, and Remix (Can't live without it now!). I love the process of transforming a cool idea into lines of code that eventually come to life as fully functional digital products, helping to make the world a better place!

Take a look around my repos to get a feel for what I've been up to. And hey, if you're up for a chat or a collab, just drop me a line. Let's code!

When it comes to building full-stack apps, I have a go-to tech stack that I absolutely love:
